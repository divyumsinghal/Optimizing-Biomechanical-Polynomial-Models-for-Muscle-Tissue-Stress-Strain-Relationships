    "# Project Overview: Optimizing Biomechanical Polynomial Models for Muscle Tissue Stress-Strain Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the mechanical properties of human muscle tissue is crucial in various fields such as biomechanics, surgical simulation, and rehabilitation engineering. The compressive properties, particularly in the transverse direction to the muscle fiber, play a significant role in these applications. By accurately modeling the stress-strain relationship, researchers can better predict tissue behavior under different loading conditions, aiding in the development of safer surgical procedures, more effective rehabilitation protocols, and improved biomechanical designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to optimize polynomial models to characterize the stress-strain relationships in human muscle tissue. By fitting regression curves to experimental data obtained from compression tests, the project aims to identify the most suitable polynomial order and fitting method for accurately capturing the nonlinear behavior of muscle tissue under loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computational Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project utilizes MATLAB for data analysis and modeling. Various computational methods are employed, including least-squares fitting, absolute error minimization, and optimization algorithms such as `fminsearch`. These methods allow for the estimation of polynomial coefficients that best represent the observed stress-strain data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is divided into several tasks, each addressing specific aspects of the modeling process. These tasks include data visualization, model fitting, error analysis, and comparison of different fitting approaches. The ultimate goal is to identify the optimal polynomial model that minimizes errors and accurately represents the complex stress-strain relationship in muscle tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of the project, we expect to have a refined understanding of the stress-strain behavior of muscle tissue and an optimized polynomial model for predicting tissue response under various loading conditions. The project outcomes will contribute to advancements in biomechanics research, surgical simulation techniques, and rehabilitation engineering practices, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and enhanced medical technologies.\n"

    "The compressive properties of human muscle tissue play a significant role in impact biomechanics, surgical simulation, and rehabilitation engineering. The primary loading direction, crucial for these applications, is transverse to the muscle fiber direction. Tests conducted at TCD on pig muscle samples using a universal testing machine revealed nonlinear anisotropic behavior under quasi-static loading conditions [1]. In this assignment, regression curves will be fitted to data from a compression test on a sample conducted in the transverse direction, denoted as cross-fiber (XF) or corresponding to the blue curve in the figure below. It will be evident that the relationship between stress and strain is not linear. Therefore, defining a constant value for the slope of the stress-strain curve (i.e., assuming a Young’s Modulus) will not yield a very good fit to the data.\n",
